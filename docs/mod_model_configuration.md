LUMASS provides two main ways of creating generic and portable models that can be easily re-configured to work with different datasets and parameter settings as well as being executed on different computers across both supported platforms, i.e. Linux and Windows.

For research and modelling applications, the probably most convenient way of configuring LUMASS models is using YAML-based configuration files. For end-user or day-to-day applications of specific models, 'user tools' that can be configured via dialog boxes might be a better alternative.
