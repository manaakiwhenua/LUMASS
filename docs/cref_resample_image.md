## Overview

The `ResampleImage` component can be used to resample an arbitrary area of a given input image using a given `InterpolationMethod`. The output area does not have to align with the current image area (or pixels) and may also only partly overlap with the input image or may be larger than the input image. In other words, the component can be used to decrease (cookie-cut) or increase (blow-up) the spatial extent of the input image,  re-align the input image's pixel (location), change the input image's spatial resolution, or do everything at the same time.
