## Properties

 Property | Characteristic | Dimension | Description 
----------|----------------|:-----------:|-------------
PixelType | compulsory,<br>user-defined, default: `float` | 0 | The data type of the input image pixel.
Nodata    | compulsory,<br>user-defined, default: `0` | 1 | Nodata value
Algorithm | compulsory,<br>user-defined, default: `MFD` | 0 | The flow accumulation algorithm {`Dinf`, `MFD`, `MFDw`}.
FlowExponent | optional,<br>user-defined, default: `4` | 0 | Flow exponent for `MFDw` algorithm.
FlowLength | compulsory,<br>user-defined, default: `NO_FLOWLENGTH` | 0 | Parameter that specifies whether flow length or flow accumulation (`NO_FLOWLENGTH`) is calculated. Either `UPSTREAM` or `DOWNSTREAM` must be selected for flow-length calculations.

## Inputs

Name            |          | Description
----------------|----------|---------------
DEM             | required | A digital elevation model that represents the height of the land surface.
FlowWeight      | optional | A weight surface representing the proportion of flow that is able to pass a given pixel downhill.

## Overview

The `RAMFlowAcc` component calculates flow accumulation (`FlowLength=NO_FLOWLENGTH`) or flow length (`FlowLength=(DOWNSTREAM | UPSTREAM)`) of individual pixels according to the specified (`Algorithm`). The output image units are given in pixels. Flow accumulation denotes the nubmer of pixels flowing into a given pixel (including the pixel itself). Flow length represents the `DOWNSTREAM` or `UPSTREAM` distance from the given pixel to the flow outlet or flow initiation point (local maximum) respectively.

**Important**: As indicated by its name, the `RAMFlowAcc` component does not support sequential processing of large images. Therefore, it can only be part of a non-streaming pipeline, i.e. a pipeline ending in a [`DataBuffer`]({{ "docs/cref_databuffer.md" | relative_url }}) component or an [`ImageWriter`]({{ "docs/cref_image_writer#properties" | relative_url }}) component with its `StreamingMethod` set to `NO_STREAMING`.
